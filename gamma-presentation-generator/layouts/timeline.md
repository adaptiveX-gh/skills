- Add time estimates when relevant
- Show progression clearly
- Highlight current position

### Don'ts ‚úó

## Gamma-Specific Tips

**Automatic Timeline Detection**:
Gamma recognizes timeline patterns when you use date/phase indicators in H3 headings.

**Date Formatting Options**:
- `### 2024` - Year only
- `### Q1 2024` - Quarter
- `### January 2024` - Month and year
- `### Jan 15, 2024` - Specific date
- `### Phase 1` - Non-date phases
- `### Week 1-2` - Duration

**Status Indicators**:
```markdown
### Q1 2024 ‚úÖ COMPLETED
### Q2 2024 üîÑ IN PROGRESS
### Q3 2024 üìÖ PLANNED
### Q4 2024 üí≠ PROPOSED

## Accessibility Notes

- Use semantic heading hierarchy (H2 for main, H3 for entries)
- Ensure chronological order is clear from text, not just visual
- Provide text descriptions for all icon indicators
- Don't rely on color alone to show status
- Test with screen readers to verify correct reading order
- Consider providing a text-only version for complex timelines
