- Don't skip items or leave gaps

## Gamma-Specific Tips

**Automatic Grid Detection**:
Gamma automatically arranges H3 (###) headings in a grid when they follow an H2 (##).

**Optimal Grid Sizes**:
- 2 items: Side-by-side (1x2)
- 3 items: Row of 3 (1x3)
- 4 items: Square grid (2x2)
- 6 items: Two rows (2x3)
- 8-9 items: Large grid (3x3)
