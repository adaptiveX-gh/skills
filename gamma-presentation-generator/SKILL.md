# Gamma Presentation Generator

## Purpose

Transform ideas, outlines, documents, or natural language prompts into well-structured, narrative-driven presentations. This skill focuses on content intelligence and narrative structure rather than just formatting - helping users organize thoughts into compelling stories that work across devices and formats.

## Core Philosophy

**Content-First Approach**: The quality of a presentation depends on narrative structure, logical flow, and compelling content - not just visual design. This skill excels at:

1. **Intelligent Content Organization**: Taking raw ideas and structuring them into logical, persuasive narratives
2. **Adaptive Structuring**: Applying appropriate narrative frameworks based on presentation goals
3. **Multi-Format Output**: Generating markdown that works across platforms (Gamma, PowerPoint, PDFs, speaker notes)
4. **Smart Enhancements**: Adding visual suggestions, speaker notes, statistics, and call-to-action elements

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when users request:

### Creation Requests
- "Create a presentation about [topic]"
- "Build a pitch deck for [product/service]"
- "Generate training slides on [subject]"
- "Make slides for my talk about [topic]"

### Conversion Requests
- "Turn this document into a presentation"
- "Convert these notes to slides"
- "Make this into Gamma format"
- "Transform this outline into a deck"

### Enhancement Requests
- "Add visuals to these slides"
- "Expand this outline into a full presentation"
- "Make this more engaging"
- "Improve the flow of this deck"

## Instructions

When a user requests a presentation, follow these steps to generate a Gamma AI-style vertical scroll presentation:

### 1. Identify the Request Type

Recognize these triggers:
- "Create a presentation about [topic]"
- "Build slides for [subject]"
- "Generate a deck on [topic]"
- "Make a presentation from [content/file]"
- "Convert [document] to slides"

### 2. Gather Requirements

Ask clarifying questions if not provided:
```
- Topic/Subject (required)
- Purpose: Inform/Educate/Persuade/Inspire
- Audience: Technical/Executive/General/Students
- Length: Number of slides or presentation duration
- Style: Professional/Creative/Academic/Casual
```

### 3. Generate Presentation Structure

Create this markdown format with `---` separating slides:

```markdown
# [Main Title]

---

## [Section Title]

[Content with bullet points, paragraphs, or features]

---

## [Next Section]

### [Subsection if needed]
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3

---
```

### 4. Content Generation Rules

#### For Title Slides:
```markdown
# [Compelling Title]
[Descriptive subtitle that sets context]
[Optional: Date, presenter name, or organization]
```

#### For Content Slides:
```markdown
## [Clear Section Header]

[Introduction paragraph if needed]

- [Concise bullet point]

2. [Main point 2]
3. [Main point 3]

**[Call to action or next steps]**
```

### 5. Apply Content Guidelines

**Length Guidelines:**
- Title slides: 1-2 sentences

- Feature slides: 3-6 features with descriptions
- Data slides: 3-5 key metrics with context

**Writing Style:**
- Use active voice
- Keep sentences under 20 words when possible
- One idea per bullet point

**Visual Suggestions:**
When appropriate, suggest images by adding:
```markdown
<!-- Image suggestion: [description of ideal image] -->
```

This instruction set ensures consistent, high-quality presentation generation that follows the Gamma AI vertical-scroll philosophy while remaining flexible enough to handle various content types and user needs.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Input

Accept and process multiple input types:

**Natural Language Prompts**:
- "Create a presentation about sustainable energy with 5 main points"
- "Build a sales pitch for our new SaaS product"

**Markdown Files**:
- Clean, structured input that can be enhanced

**Bullet Points/Outlines**:
- Quick thoughts that need expansion and structure

**Existing Documents**:
- Content that needs restructuring into presentation format

### Step 2: Determine Presentation Goal

Ask the user (if not clear from context) what their goal is:

**Teaching/Educational**:
- Structure: Concept â†’ Example â†’ Practice
- Focus: Clear explanations, step-by-step progression
- Template: `templates/educational.md`

**Selling/Pitching**:
- Structure: Problem â†’ Solution â†’ Benefits â†’ Proof
- Focus: Emotional resonance, clear value proposition
- Template: `templates/pitch-deck.md`

**Informing/Reporting**:
- Structure: Overview â†’ Details â†’ Summary
- Focus: Clear data presentation, key takeaways
- Template: `templates/status-update.md`

**Inspiring/Storytelling**:
- Structure: Setup â†’ Conflict â†’ Resolution
- Focus: Emotional arc, relatability, transformation
- Template: `templates/storytelling.md`

**Training/Workshop**:
- Structure: Theory â†’ Demo â†’ Hands-on â†’ Reflection
- Focus: Interactive elements, practice exercises
- Template: `templates/workshop.md`

### Step 3: Apply Appropriate Structure

Based on the goal, select and apply the right narrative framework from the templates directory:

- `templates/pitch-deck.md` - For fundraising, sales pitches, product launches
- `templates/educational.md` - For courses, tutorials, how-to presentations
- `templates/status-update.md` - For project updates, quarterly reviews, team reports
- `templates/workshop.md` - For hands-on training sessions, interactive learning
- `templates/storytelling.md` - For narrative-driven talks, case studies, journey stories

Each template provides:
- Proven slide sequences
- Section descriptions
- Content guidelines
- Visual recommendations

### Step 4: Apply Layout Patterns

For each slide, recommend appropriate layout patterns from the `layouts/` directory:

**Hero Slide** (`layouts/hero-slide.md`):
- Opening slides
- Section breaks
- Key messages
- Powerful quotes

**Feature Grid** (`layouts/feature-grid.md`):
- Product features
- Team members
- Benefits lists
- Service offerings

**Timeline** (`layouts/timeline.md`):
- Roadmaps
- Company history
- Project phases
- Process flows

**Comparison** (`layouts/comparison.md`):
- Pricing tiers
- Before/after
- Us vs competitors
- Option evaluation

**Data Visualization** (`layouts/data-viz.md`):
- Metrics and KPIs
- Survey results
- Financial data
- Analytics

### Step 5: Enhance Content

Add intelligent enhancements to raw content:

**Visual Suggestions**:
- "This data would work well as a bar chart"
- "Consider adding a timeline here"
- "Use a comparison table for these options"
- Include layout hints in comments

**Speaker Notes**:
- Add speaking points below slides
- Include transitions and pacing notes
- Suggest emphasis points

**Supporting Data**:
- Add relevant statistics when appropriate
- Include industry benchmarks
- Suggest places for case studies

**Call-to-Action**:
- End with clear next steps
- Include contact information
- Provide follow-up resources

### Step 6: Optimize for Readability

Apply content intelligence rules:

**Slide Pacing**:
- Max 3-5 bullet points per slide
- Max 10-15 words per bullet
- Suggest splitting dense slides

**Visual Hierarchy**:
- Use H1 (#) for slide titles
- Use H2 (##) for main sections
- Use H3 (###) for grid items or sub-sections
- Use lists for sequential information

**Readability**:
- Short sentences
- Active voice
- Strong verbs
- Concrete examples

**Mobile-Friendly**:
- Content scales on small screens
- Images have proper aspect ratios
- Minimum font sizes enforced

## Output Format

Generate markdown with the following structure:

```markdown
# [Slide Title]

[Optional subtitle or key message]

[Main content with proper formatting]

---

<!-- Layout suggestion: hero-slide -->
<!-- Visual: Consider adding background image -->
<!-- Speaker note: Pause here for questions -->
```

Include helpful comments for:
